Hi! I am a Graduate Student at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/). My research interests primarily lie in the field of condensed matter physics, and I am currently working on correlated physics in van der Waals heterostrucutres with the [Polshyn Group](https://polshynlab.com/).

I hold a BS-MS Degree from [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/), with a major in Physics. For my Master Thesis I worked on fabrication of Suspended Graphene-MoS<sub>2</sub> Heterostructures for the study of proximity effects in Graphene in a low dielectric environment at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, with [Prof. Thomas Weitz](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/617481.html).
